create a method that divides two numbers
  public int Divide(int x, int y)
        {
            return x / y;
        }
 
 
 
 //if we know there could be problems within specifc areas of our application, we can use try catch
  static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            try
            {
                var calc = new Calculator();
                var result = calc.Divide(5, 0);
            }
            catch (Exception)
            {
//the below message is much better than the scary ones that appear at us.
                Console.WriteLine("Problem at section of application example");
            }
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
