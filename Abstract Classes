1. We will start with the abstract class

using System;
namespace ConsoleApp1
{
    //abstract classes must be declared abstract at the class level in order to create abstract methods.
    public abstract class Country
    {
        public abstract void Language(); // Here we declare an abstract method
        public abstract void Food(); // Here we declare an additional abstract method
	
	// Now below is an important thing to remeber, You can create a normal method in a abstract class, but you will not be able
	to instantiate this method until it has been inherited from a non-abstract class
        public void PLay()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Playing");
        }
    }
}

2. Below is a non-abstract class that we will use to implement the abstract class above.

using System;
namespace ConsoleApp1
{
   //implment the abstract class as you would a class you were inheriting from ":"
   public class SouthAfrica: Country
    {
    	//all abstract methods must be declared or the application will not run, use the override keyword to implment the abstract method.
        public override void Language()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Ons praat Afrikaans");
        }
        public override void Food()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Ons eet varke");
        }
    }
}

3. Below is the main program class.

using System;
namespace ConsoleApp1
{
    class Solution
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
	    //we instantiate the non-abstract class and then implment both abstract and non abstrcat methods!
            SouthAfrica sa = new SouthAfrica();
            sa.PLay();
            sa.Language();
            sa.Food();
            Console.ReadLine();
        }

    }
}
